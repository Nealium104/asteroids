# Hi there

This is a copy of the game Asteroids. It uses pygame.

# How do I run it?

First, clone the repo, then install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then activate your venv and run main.py. It should open a window with the game running. If it doesn't, make sure you have a way to run a GUI on your system. I developed it on windows with WSL2, so I needed XLaunch installed
